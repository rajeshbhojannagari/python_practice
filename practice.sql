-- code 1: Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.
--The STATION table is described as follows:
--SELECT count(CITY)- count(distinct CITY) FROM STATION;

--code 2: Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
--The STATION table is described as follows:
-- (SELECT CITY,LENGTH(CITY) as city_length FROM STATION ORDER BY
--LENGTH(CITY),CITY limit 1) UNION (SELECT CITY,LENGTH(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY)DESC,CITY limit 1);

--code 3: Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
--SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE CITY like 'a%'or CITY like'e%' or CITY like 'i%' or CITY like 'o%' or CITY like 'u%';

--code 4: Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
--SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE CITY like '%a'or CITY like'%e' or CITY like '%i' or CITY like '%o' or CITY like '%u';

--code 5: Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
--SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE CITY REGEXP '^[AEIOU].*[AEIOU]$';

--code 6: Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
--SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE CITY not like 'a%' and CITY not like 'e%' AND CITY not like 'i%' and CITY not like 'o%' and CITY not like 'u%';

--code 7: Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
--SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE CITY not like '%a' and CITY not like '%e' AND CITY not like '%i' and CITY not like '%o' and CITY not like '%u';

--code 8: Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
--SELECT DISTINCT CITY from STATION WHERE CITY NOT  REGEXP '^[AEIOU].*[AEIOU]$';

--code 9: Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels and do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
--SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE CITY not REGEXP '^[AEIOU].' AND CITY not REGEXP '[AEIOU]$';
